## Why startup fail

-   Do not build a startup with the goal of passive income, as 90% of startups fail.
-   **No real problem** - Fail to solve a meaningful problem to others (not you).
-   **Poor marketing** - Do not have a robust strategy for acquiring and retaining customers.
-   **No differentiation** - Without a clear way of differentiating from others, it is hard to break through.

## Why do startup

-   Escape the 9 to 5.
-   Escape hourly ceiling.
-   Escape the boss and clients, with the caveat that the cusotmers become your boss.
-   Additional revenue stream.

### Exceptions

-   For fun.
-   To learn.
-   To help out community, organization, or person.

## 4 step process

1. Review the market.
2. Understand your audience.
3. Define your minimum viable product.
4. Run a test marketing campaign.

## Review the market

**Goal** - Before taking any action, it's crucial to understand who else is addressing similar issues and the current market landscape.

### Why do market research

-   **Define your audience** - Find the niche to target.
-   **Define your features** - What features to build initially.
-   **Identify market challenges** - What challenges you may face when you attempt to go to market.

    - **Your type of offering** - What type of app are you creating and what is the rough extent of its functionality.
    - **Your particular audience** - What specific audience are you going to initially focus on when initially launching the product.
    - Do not go too broad. The smaller the audience the more you will get out of your limited marketing budget.
    - For example, frontend masters focus on developers, and developers talk amongst themselves, follow common socials, and word-of-mouth helps you grow and build trust. Later, you use their testimonials when going to larger audience.
2. Find your competitors (check [What to look for in competitors](#what-to-look-for-in-competitors))

    - G2

    - News and publications
3. Try the competition's offering
    - Sign up for demos and free trials for the biggest players in the market.
    - Assess features, usability.

        Mailchimp had this feature, where after sending an email it would high five you and you can tap the hand and it would turn into a fist.\

### Decide if you want to compete

-   Reviewing the market can lead to the harsh realization that it will be hard to compete without considerable investment.
-   Instead of starting a new business, you can reach out to the competitors and offer them help. Look into channel partnerships or plugin marketplace. After you have got your foot in, you can explore starting your own business as well.
-   Be careful about making your idea dependent on other business. Like Amazon collects data on people who sell on their marketplace, and then they just copy your product. Or you create a plugin, but then the company decides to copy the plugin or break the API, like Twitter disabled their API.

## Understand your audience

**Goal** - Motivate your audience by being highly focused and understanding of their needs.

### Adapt app to audience

-   **Features** - What precisely the app will do should be tailored to the needs of your audience.
-   **Top tasks** - Which features you highlight will depend on what your audience uses most.
-   **Messaging** - How you communicate with your audience will be dependent on who they are.
-   Do not develop an app and try to find an audience for it, since the finding the perfect audience is improbable.
