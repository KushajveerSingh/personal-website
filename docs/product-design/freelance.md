## Overview

-   Why you are struggling to find clients.
-   Define the market you wish to target.
-   Get the attention of your audience.
-   Get permission for ongoing contact.
-   Maintain and growing your audience.
-   Turn leads into projects.

## What we want from marketing

-   **More** - More work to generate money during the quiet time.
-   **Better** - If you are stuck working for the same type of client, like making small websites which are is a heavy price sensitive area, then you might want better clients.
-   **Easier** - Rather than pitching your work, which requires time and energy, it is easier if clients want to work specifically with you.

## Why you are struggling to find clients

-   Relying too heavily on word of mouth.
    -   **Passive** - Your revenue is dependent as asking clients for recommendations.
    -   **Limiting** - Word of mouth happens within sectors and companies of similar size. So it limits you to break into new sectors or gain bigger clients.
    -   **Risky** - Since word of mouth happens within different groups of a large organization, you can become dependent on one or two large clients whose departure would be devastating.
-   Wasting money on online ads or using marketplaces.
    -   Places like Upwork tend to attract smaller businesses who primarily choose based on price.
    -   Most of the large projects on these sites already have a supplier, but due to compliance they have to post the project.
    -   There is no relationship. You are just another supplier.
-   Content marketing (blog, podcast) challenges.
    -   **Too much noise** - Hard to get people's attention with so much noise online.
    -   **Gone and forgotten** - Even if somebody sees your content, they will quickly move on and be unlikely to remember you when they are looking for services you apply.
    -   **Locaking time** - Producing content is time consuming, which you could have used for doing client work.

### Using email as a solution

-   **B2B lives in email** - Primary means of communication for almost all businesses.
-   **You will be seen** - Poeple may not read every email they receive, but they will see it. Same is not true for social mead.
-   **You will be read** - The percentage of people that read your email are pretty high.

### How to make people aware of your email

-   Subsribe them with a sales funnel.

#### Sales funnel

-   Journey you take a prospective client on from first hearing about you to the moment they sign up for your service.
-   Steps in a sales funnel
    1. Attract attention.
    2. Build a connection.
    3. Keep engaging.
    4. Encourage contact.
    5. Close a sale.

#### Why build sales funnel

-   **Targeted** - Target a particular group of clients we would like to work with.
-   **Consistent** - Provide's relative consistent and reliable source of new clients.
-   **Controllable** - By tweaking your sales funnel and the messaging, you can control the type of client and work you win. If you want on prototyping, you can send the next 3 emails discussing that, and that should attract prototyping related work.

### Referrals

-   For a high end service, like software engineering, referrals (where client gets 10%) seem out of place.
-   Paul tried and it did not work. Paul tried it with email (people refer to subscribe to email), it didn't work much as well. He tried the gamification as well.
