## Resources

-   [link](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178) The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn by _Richard W. Hamming_ (432 pages) (May 26, 2020)

## Purpose of book

-   Why some scientists do great work, why most don't.
-   Teach the style of thinking.
    -   Style cannot be "talked about" instead it has to be experienced, similar to god, truth, art, beauty, love.
-   Greatness is defined with the conception of science and engineering as public serivce.
-   Teachers should prepare the student for the student's future, not for the teacher's past.
    -   Although future is uncertain and usually based on the past, the past is also uncertain-or even falsely reported-than is usually recognized.
    -   Due to the pace of progress the future is rather disconnected from the past, example the presense of modern computer.
-   The future of science and enginnering will be more mathematical than the past.
-   You need both education (what, when, and why to do things) and training (how to do things).
-   Knowledge doubles roughly every 17 years. Over the course of 34 year career (around your peak or retirement), the knowledge would have quadrupled.
    -   Focus on things that are considered fundamentals at the time.
        -   Fundamentals last a long time.
        -   Fundamentals can be used to derive all the rest of the field using the standard method.
    -   Learn new fields (on your own) as they arise you as to not be left behind.

## Motivation

-   Short term predictions are always optimistic and long-term predictions are always pessimistic.
-   In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to _n_, while no vision will get you only the distance _√n_.
    -   The accuracy of vision matters less. There are many paths to greatness.
-   With only one life to live on this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along through life comfortably.
    -   The true gain is in the struggle and not in the achievement.
-   Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

## Things great scientists do

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations.

-   Create a modal of the phenomenon and check if the numbers being presented are in agreement (use when you hear quantitative remarks).
    -   For example, knowledge double every 17 years and 90% of scientists who ever lived are now alive.
    -   Model knoweledge over time `y(t) = ae^(bt)`.
    -   Model knowledge as linear over number of people `y(x) = mx`.
    -   Assume scientist lives for 55 years, and from here you can check the claim that 90% claim.
    -   Further you can modal the age of scientist and knowledge doubling years as variables, and see what ratios satisty the 90% claim.
-   Reason uage. You get a good feeling for the truth or falsity of what was claimed, as well as realize which factors you were inclined not to think about. Additionally having done the calculation you are much more likely to retain the results in your mind.

### Understand future of your field

-   Devote Friday afternoons trying to understand what would happen in the future in your field, both as a scientific tool and as a shaper of the social world of work and play.
-   Think about these three questions
    -   What is possible? - Science.
    -   What is likely to happen? - Engineering. The desirable outcome will help guide this.
    -   What is desirable to have happen? - Value judgement.

## Affect of simulations

-   It is cheaper to do simulations than real experiments, more flexibility in testing, possible to do things that are not possible in the lab.
-   But you should occasionally still look at nature as she is.
-   Simulation is also bringing engineering closer to science.
    -   Since everything can be done with simulation. Human factor is becoming more important for a better design.

## Growth S curve

-   The growth of fields follow S-shaped curve. Things begin slowly, then rise rapidly, and later flatten off as they hit some natural limits.
-   Often new innvoation will set the growth of a field ont a new S curvewhich takes off from around the saturation level of the old one.
