## Mind v/s Brain

-   **Mind** - Similar to algorithm.
-   **Brain** - Hardware that executes the algorithm.

## Goal of book

Take a cognitive approach to describe the steps by which the mind (of an experienced reader) reads without specifying how the brain carries out those steps.

_Sociocultural view_ not included in this.

-   Role of social environment in reading, what you read, how often you read, your interpretation of what you read.

### Why psychologists not focus on brain

-   Hard to describe the steps, and the steps are ever evolving with our understanding of the field.
    -   The steps used are indicative of our current knowledge.
-   Most of the mind is recruited to address even moderately complex tasks, so the explanation would be dauntingly complex.

## History

-   Reading is 6,000 years old.

## Traits of a strong reader
