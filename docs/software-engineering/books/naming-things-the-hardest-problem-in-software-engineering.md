## Why is naming important?

- Code is for a human first and a computer second.
- Professional engineers pay more attention to the name of the identifiers than source code comments.
- Good naming -> Understandable code -> Efficient maintenance
- Helps new team members understand the codebase.
- To write good names, an engineer must understand the domain and associated terminology. Domain expertise leads to leadership roles and career growth.

Good naming helps with

- _Comprehension_ - The ability of software engineer to **understand** the logic, structure, and purpose of the code.
- _Recall_ - The ability of a software engineer to **remember** the logic, structure, and purpose of the code.
- _Defect resolution time_ - The duration between when a software engineer starts working on a defect and when they resolve the defect.

## Why is naming hard?

- Dynamic, subjective requirements
    - The concept being named is dynamic, and often evolves over time. Also, the concept and its name is dependent on the domain, which can also change over time.
    - The audience reading the name is dyanmic. We can guess the audience at the time of naming, but the audience may change over time.
    - The way name's correctness is judged is subjective. Understandability and conciseness are determined by the audience.
- Insufficient best practices and tooling
    - There is no industry-wide standard.
    - Lack of tooling for enforcing high-quality naming.
- Short-term costs and long-term value
    - Costs of good naming are mostly immediate and its value is mostly long-term.
