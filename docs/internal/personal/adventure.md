Research study on how long trails like AT affect mentality o people over the course of time.
Case 1. A guy with depression started PCT and it got resolved.
Case 2. Met a guy on 2nd day of his AT journey, and he got emotional.
Check the application of this study on what health problems it can solve, and how doctors can integrate this.
If this study does get big, you don't want 1000 people showing up at AT, as that will cause trail degradation. Study can be expanded on how to resolve this as well.
