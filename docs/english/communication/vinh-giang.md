## Communication traps that make smart people look insecure, unprepared, unqualified

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uzvqk4Q4LM)

### Delivery blindspot

**Problem** - When speaking 100% of their cognitive capacity goes into what they say and 0% into how they actually say it.

-   Reason why this happens is most people grow up rewarded for their technical ability, not for their ability to communicate.
-   Ideas don't speak for itself.

**Solution** - Split the attention 50/50 between how you say it and what you say.

-   Use Vocal-Visual-Verbal framework.
-   Vocal - Add melody to your voice. When speaking about something serious, speak with a lower pitch, convery passion with higher pitch.
-   Visual - Match your facial expression to the tone of your words. If talking about something facinating, show the facinating look on your face.
-   Verbal - Simplify your language and don't use complex jargon to try to sound smart.

### Imposter disclaimer

**Problem** - You disqualify yourself when you start the sentences with

-   I'm not the best person to answer this but...
-   This might be stupid but...
-   I haven't really thought this through but...

Why people do this

-   You value humility and being humble, but this is not the place for that.
-   Imposter syndrome kick's in and you lower people's expectations so it dosen't disappoint anyone.
-   You fear being judged for sounding too confident.

**Solution** - Remove the disclaimers and start with

-   Here's my idea.
-   Here's my perspective.
-   Here's one idea we could explore.
-   A recommendation is.

### Content Shield

**Problem** - You use big words, long explanations, and overly complicated frameworks. Because you associate complixity with credibility.

Why people do this

-   You're afraid of being wrong.
-   You're afraid of follow-up questions.
-   You're over-compensating for imposter syndrome.

**Solution**

-   Say the headline first. One clean sentence to summarize your point.
-   Add detail to support your point, only if someone asks for clarification.

### Micro-checking loop

**Problem** - Every sentence ending with

-   Right?
-   Yeah?
-   Does that make sense?
-   Do you know what I mean?
-   Sorry I just have a quick question... (when micro-checking happens in the beginning).

Why people do this

-   Hyper-sensitivity to how you're coming across to others.
-   Hyper-awareness of people's facial expressions.
-   Scanning the room for consistent validation and subtle need for approval in real time.

**Solution**

-   Finish your sentence on a low pitch.
-   Pause after you finish your sentence.
-   Let the point land.
-   Then ask for clarity like this
    -   Is that clear?
    -   Did you have any questions?
    -   Would you like me to expand on any points (that I spoke about)?

### Disappearing Spine Syndrome

**Problem** - When sharing an idea, the very moment you sense disagreement, you abandon your point completely.

-   Your idea disappears before it even has a chance to stand.

Why people do this

-   You put too much emphasis on the first sign of resistance.
-   You have a strong desire to be agreeable and not cause conflict.

**Solution**

-   Pause when you sense disagreement.
-   Take a deep breath.
-   Slow down your rate of speech and finish your point.
-   You can also use the anchor and invite technique
    -   Anchor - I believe this is the right direction for us because...
    -   Invite - And I'm open to hearing your perspectives too.
