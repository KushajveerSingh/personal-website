## Communication traps that make smart people look insecure, unprepared, unqualified

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uzvqk4Q4LM)

### Delivery blindspot

**Problem** - When speaking 100% of their cognitive capacity goes into what they say and 0% into how they actually say it.

- Reason why this happens is most people grow up rewarded for their technical ability, not for their ability to communicate.
- Ideas don't speak for itself.

**Solution** - Split the attention 50/50 between how you say it and what you say.

- Use Vocal-Visual-Verbal framework.
- Vocal - Add melody to your voice. When speaking about something serious, speak with a lower pitch, convery passion with higher pitch.
- Visual - Match your facial expression to the tone of your words. If talking about something facinating, show the facinating look on your face.
- Verbal - Simplify your language and don't use complex jargon to try to sound smart.

### Imposter disclaimer

**Problem** - You disqualify yourself when you start the sentences with

- I'm not the best person to answer this but...
- This might be stupid but...
- I haven't really thought this through but...

Why people do this

- You value humility and being humble, but this is not the place for that.
- Imposter syndrome kick's in and you lower people's expectations so it dosen't disappoint anyone.
- You fear being judged for sounding too confident.

**Solution** - Remove the disclaimers and start with

- Here's my idea.
- Here's my perspective.
- Here's one idea we could explore.
- A recommendation is.

### Content Shield

**Problem** - You use big words, long explanations, and overly complicated frameworks. Because you associate complixity with credibility.

Why people do this

- You're afraid of being wrong.
- You're afraid of follow-up questions.
- You're over-compensating for imposter syndrome.

**Solution**

- Say the headline first. One clean sentence to summarize your point.
- Add detail to support your point, only if someone asks for clarification.

### Micro-checking loop

**Problem** - Every sentence ending with

- Right?
- Yeah?
- Does that make sense?
- Do you know what I mean?
- Sorry I just have a quick question... (when micro-checking happens in the beginning).

Why people do this

- Hyper-sensitivity to how you're coming across to others.
- Hyper-awareness of people's facial expressions.
- Scanning the room for consistent validation and subtle need for approval in real time.

**Solution**

- Finish your sentence on a low pitch.
- Pause after you finish your sentence.
- Let the point land.
- Then ask for clarity like this
    - Is that clear?
    - Did you have any questions?
    - Would you like me to expand on any points (that I spoke about)?

### Disappearing Spine Syndrome

**Problem** - When sharing an idea, the very moment you sense disagreement, you abandon your point completely.

- Your idea disappears before it even has a chance to stand.

Why people do this

- You put too much emphasis on the first sign of resistance.
- You have a strong desire to be agreeable and not cause conflict.

**Solution**

- Pause when you sense disagreement.
- Take a deep breath.
- Slow down your rate of speech and finish your point.
- You can also use the anchor and invite technique
    - Anchor - I believe this is the right direction for us because...
    - Invite - And I'm open to hearing your perspectives too.
