## Communication Traps That Make Smart People Look Insecure, Unprepared, Unqualified

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uzvqk4Q4LM)

### Delivery blindspot

**Problem** - When speaking 100% of their cognitive capacity goes into what they say and 0% into how they actually say it.

- Reason why this happens is most people grow up rewarded for their technical ability, not for their ability to communicate.
- Ideas don't speak for itself.

**Solution** - Split the attention 50/50 between how you say it and what you say.

- Use Vocal-Visual-Verbal framework.
- Vocal - Add melody to your voice. When speaking about something serious, speak with a lower pitch, convery passion with higher pitch.
- Visual - Match your facial expression to the tone of your words. If talking about something facinating, show the facinating look on your face.
- Verbal - Simplify your language and don't use complex jargon to try to sound smart.

### Imposter disclaimer

**Problem** - You disqualify yourself when you start the sentences with

- I'm not the best person to answer this but...
- This might be stupid but...
- I haven't really thought this through but...

Why people do this

- You value humility and being humble, but this is not the place for that.
- Imposter syndrome kick's in and you lower people's expectations so it dosen't disappoint anyone.
- You fear being judged for sounding too confident.

**Solution** - Remove the disclaimers and start with

- Here's my idea.
- Here's my perspective.
- Here's one idea we could explore.
- A recommendation is.

### Content Shield

**Problem** - You use big words, long explanations, and overly complicated frameworks. Because you associate complixity with credibility.

Why people do this

- You're afraid of being wrong.
- You're afraid of follow-up questions.
- You're over-compensating for imposter syndrome.

**Solution**

- Say the headline first. One clean sentence to summarize your point.
- Add detail to support your point, only if someone asks for clarification.

### Micro-checking loop

**Problem** - Every sentence ending with

- Right?
- Yeah?
- Does that make sense?
- Do you know what I mean?
- Sorry I just have a quick question... (when micro-checking happens in the beginning).

Why people do this

- Hyper-sensitivity to how you're coming across to others.
- Hyper-awareness of people's facial expressions.
- Scanning the room for consistent validation and subtle need for approval in real time.

**Solution**

- Finish your sentence on a low pitch.
- Pause after you finish your sentence.
- Let the point land.
- Then ask for clarity like this
    - Is that clear?
    - Did you have any questions?
    - Would you like me to expand on any points (that I spoke about)?

### Disappearing Spine Syndrome

**Problem** - When sharing an idea, the very moment you sense disagreement, you abandon your point completely.

- Your idea disappears before it even has a chance to stand.

Why people do this

- You put too much emphasis on the first sign of resistance.
- You have a strong desire to be agreeable and not cause conflict.

**Solution**

- Pause when you sense disagreement.
- Take a deep breath.
- Slow down your rate of speech and finish your point.
- You can also use the anchor and invite technique
    - Anchor - I believe this is the right direction for us because...
    - Invite - And I'm open to hearing your perspectives too.

## 5 Minute Ritual Before Doing Any Presentation

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qM83MX_ggg)

### Psychological - Become audience-conscious

- Thinking about yourself or what the audience is thinking about you, makes you more self-conscious.
    - The more self-conscious you become, the more nervous you become.
- Before walking to give the presentation look at the audience from the side, thinking about how you change the lives of the people with this talk.
    - By doing you have no cognitive capacity left to think about yourself.

### Physiological - Remove adrenaline before the stage

- Symptoms of nerviousness shaky voice, shaky body, fidgeting, poor eye contact, sweating.
    - This happens from the flight-and-fight response which dumps adrenaline in your body.
    - This also makes you flee. This is why when people walk in for the presentation, they keep walking back away from the audience.
- Do brisk forms of exercise behind the stage.
    - Jumping jacks, walk, push-ups.
- Just before walking on stage, do skip walking to put yourself in a playful energy. This is not done in front of the audience.

### Laugh

- Watch funny videos.

### Do Wim Hof Breathing

- Do 2-3 cycles.

## 5 Storytelling Mistakes

[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJSG3Xyev94)

### Audience Blinkdness

**Problem** - When you get so caught up in telling the story that you don't realise the audience has checked out and are not listening anymore.

Symptoms

- Giving too much irrelevant information.
- Not giving essential context and details.
- Not having a clear point to the story.

**Solution** - Before telling a story focus on these questions

- What context and details are essential for this story to make sense?
- What's the one thing I want them to walk away with?
- Only tell the story around relevant context and details, and the point of the story - cut out everything else.

### Achievement dumping

**Problem** - When you only share the highlights reel of your life without sharing the relatable moments of struggle and of the journey. Poeple can't connect with your success, they connect with your struggle.

**Solution**

- When you share a win, pair it with a cost.

### Speaking from a wound, not a scar

**Problem** - Sharing from a wound is speaking while the pain is still raw and unhealed (you are still dealing with the emotions, also the audience now has to focus on comforting you); whereas sharing from a scar is speaking after healing, offering wisdom and perspective (you have clarity, emotional control).

When sharing an unhealed vunerable story

- The audience feels responsible for your healing.
- You leave the audience with heavy feelings.
- You make the audience your therapist.

**Solution** - Use TSL framework.

- Test - Test in a safe environment first, with your trusted friends, to gauge your emotional comfort level.
- Stabilise - Stabilise your emotions.
- Lead - Lead with the lesson.

### Making it all about you

**Problem** - The audience in addition to listening to your story, are also trying to see themselves in the story. They are asking

- Can I relate to this story?
- What can I learn from this story?
- Can I apply this story to me?

**Solution** - Include these 3 elements in every story you tell

- Include your experiences in the story.
- Include the universal human moments that they can relate to.
- Include the values, lessons they can take from it.

### Preaching vs sharing

**Problem** - What you share feels like a lecture. Multiple signs that you are preaching

- You lecture instead of relate.
- You parrot (repeat) the lesson.
- Guru energy, where you talk like you are a god.

    > Suggest adjustments to rhythm, pacing, or energy that could make it more dynamic and alive.
    > Audience Connection
    > Help me see whether I’m speaking to the audience or at them.
    > Suggest language shifts that make my message more relatable, human, and conversational.
    > Practical Communication Advice
    > Give me 3–5 concrete changes I can make that would have the biggest immediate impact on my communication effectiveness.
    > If relevant, include a short rewritten excerpt that shows what “great” would sound like.

### Create 12-week plan

- For each week pick one behavior (from any category), and work on improving that.
- At the end of the week, do another record and review session.
- If you did not make desired improvement, repeat the week with the same behavior.
- Only after you have improved the behavior, you move on to the next behavior.
